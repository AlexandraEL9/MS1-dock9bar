<h1 align="center">Milestone 1 Project- Dock 9 Bar</h1>

[View the live project here.](#)[Coming Soon]

This is step one of a promotional website for Dock 9, an existing bar and brewery acquired and under new management, which is part of an exciting regeneration project in Salford Quays. The company aims are to mix old school and traditional brewing techniques and craftsmanship with modern accents in a nod to the industrial past and modern present of the area. The area has a large residential population as well as a number of creative industries, a retail shopping outlet and cultural sites such as museums, art galleries and Old Trafford Football Staduim all within walking distance of eachother and accessible by the Metrolink Tram Network. As such, the company would like to not only attract new patrons, but also begin to build itself into the heart of the community, eventually becoming a community hub.<br> This project was completed for the Milestone 1 project in Level 5 Web Application and Development. It is designed to be responsive and accessible on a range of devices, making it easy to navigate for potential and returning patrons.

-   ### Design

    -   #### Colour Scheme
        *Brand Colours*: **Dock 9**<br>
-#18273A, a dark navy blue.  Used  mostly for title/header sections <br>
-#9AB4D5, a lighter blue. Mostly used for   main content sections to contrast with the dark blue whilst keeping the theme. <br>
-#ff3df9, a neon pink. Used for highlights, outlines, buttons etc.<br>
-White and blach were ised in the navbar and footer and in typography for contrast.

- The main colours used are ##18273A(a rich dark grblur)r headings and some text on light backgrounds, cadetblue,(a medium turquoise/green), for the main body backgrounds, #ff3df9,(a bright neon pink) for icons and flourishes and antiquewhite used for text on dark backgrounds..


    -   #### Typography
        -   The Roboto font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case Roboto isn't being imported into the site correctly. Roboto is a clean and simple font used frequently so it is both attractive and fit for purpose.
    -   #### Imagery
        -   The large, background hero image of a neon bar sign is designed to be striking and catch the user's attention. It also has a modern aesthetic and makes the context of the site clear straight away.

**Features To Achieve These Goals**

-The website uses responsive design so it can be seen on different devices easily.
-The site has a navigation bar so movement from 1 page to another is simple. Similarly, the footer has links to social media.
-The site is set up so the most basic information is accessible first (who, what, where, when) with added details on subsequent pages.
-The site color scheme matches the design of the bar's upgrade and branding so users see the site as an extension of the bar and vice versa creating synergy and allowing the user to feel what the bar is/ may be like.
-The site pages include page specific reviews, linked to the page content so users can see positive reviews of the section they are currently reading.
-There is a contact form making interaction easy.
-There are downloadable menus with prices so patrons can look and check at their leisure, prior to visit.
-Each page has a subscribe to the newsletter section, encouraging patrons to keep in touch with the bar.

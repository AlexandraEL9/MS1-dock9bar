<h1 align="center">Milestone 1 Project- Dock 9 Bar</h1>

[View the live project here.](https://alexandrael9.github.io/MS1-dock9bar/index.html)

This is step one of a promotional website for Dock 9, an existing bar and brewery acquired and under new management, which is part of an exciting regeneration project in Salford Quays. The company aims are to mix old school and traditional brewing techniques and craftsmanship with modern accents in a nod to the industrial past and modern present of the area. The area has a large residential population as well as a number of creative industries, a retail shopping outlet and cultural sites such as museums, art galleries and Old Trafford Football Staduim all within walking distance of eachother and accessible by the Metrolink Tram Network. As such, the company would like to not only attract new patrons, but also begin to build itself into the heart of the community, eventually becoming a community hub.<br> 
- This project was completed for the Milestone 1 project in Level 5 Web Application and Development. It is designed to be responsive and accessible on a range of devices, making it easy to navigate for potential and returning patrons.

3. As a Returning Visitor, I want to locate their social media links to join their followings on social media.

2. As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any new products or menu items.

**Features To Achieve These Goals**

- The website uses responsive design so it can be seen on different devices easily.<br>
- The site has a navigation bar so movement from 1 page to another is simple. Similarly, the footer has links to social media.<br>
- The site is set up so the most basic information is accessible first (who, what, where, when) with added details on subsequent pages.<br>
- The site color scheme matches the design of the bar's upgrade and branding so users see the site as an extension of the bar and vice versa creating synergy and allowing the user to feel what the bar is/ may be like.<br>
- The site pages include page specific reviews, linked to the page content so users can see positive reviews of the section they are currently reading.<br>
- There is a contact form making interaction easy.<br>
- There are downloadable menus with prices so patrons can look and check at their leisure, prior to visit.<br>
- Each page has a subscribe to the newsletter section, encouraging patrons to keep in touch with the bar.<br>

 ### Design

**Colour Scheme**

-#18273A, a dark navy blue.  Used  mostly for title/header sections <br>
-#9AB4D5, a lighter blue. Mostly used for main content sections to contrast with the dark blue whilst keeping the theme. <br>
-#ff3df9, a neon pink. Used for highlights, outlines, buttons etc.<br>
-White and black were used in the navbar and footer and in typography for contrast.

![Colour scheme](./docs/colour-scheme.png)

- The two shades of blue are a nod to traditional 'heritage' colours of old fashioned pubs, the navy blue especially referencing the nautical and industrial past of the area. A dark and light shade were chosed so they could be used to 'section off' parts of the webpage.<br>
- The bright, neon pink is a quirky reference the the area's current iteration as a culture and media hub, referencing the neon lights of the BBC and ITV buildings and the Lowry Theatre shining and bouncing off the water of the Quays.<br>
- Black is used for the navbar and footer, giving the site pages a clear top and bottom/ start and end point.

#### Typography
- The Roboto font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the back-up font in case Roboto isn't being imported into the site correctly. Roboto is a clean and simple font which is clear and easy to read used frequently so it is both attractive and fit for purpose.

#### Imagery
-   The large, background hero image of a neon bar sign is striking and catch the user's attention, providing immediate impact. It also has a modern aesthetic and makes the context of the site clear straight away.


* ### Wireframes
I used [Balsamiq Wireframes](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/) to create wireframes before starting the project to help me plan the layout and flow of the project.<br>
When I was creating my website, the design plan was changed. Having never done the process before and lacking experience, my first designs were far to simple and lacking content and I had more time to add extra features to the site to add value, for examle, adding page specific reviews with images and a subscription form on every page.

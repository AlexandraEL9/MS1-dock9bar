<h1 align="center">Milestone 1 Project- Dock 9 Bar</h1>

[View the live project here.](https://alexandrael9.github.io/MS1-dock9bar/index.html)

This is step one of a promotional website for Dock 9, an existing bar and brewery acquired and under new management, which is part of an exciting regeneration project in Salford Quays. The company aims are to mix old school and traditional brewing techniques and craftsmanship with modern accents in a nod to the industrial past and modern present of the area. The area has a large residential population as well as a number of creative industries, a retail shopping outlet and cultural sites such as museums, art galleries and Old Trafford Football Staduim all within walking distance of eachother and accessible by the Metrolink Tram Network. As such, the company would like to not only attract new patrons, but also begin to build itself into the heart of the community, eventually becoming a community hub.<br> 
- This project was completed for the Milestone 1 project in Level 5 Web Application and Development. It is designed to be responsive and accessible on a range of devices, making it easy to navigate for potential and returning patrons.

**Planned Features To Achieve These Goals**

- The website will use responsive design so it can be seen on different devices easily.<br>
- The site will have a navigation bar so movement from 1 page to another is simple. Similarly, the footer will have the bar's links to social media.<br>
- The site's content will be structured so the most basic information is accessible first (who, what, where, when) with added details or information in more depth will be on subsequent pages.<br>
- The site 's pages will nclude page specific reviews, linked to the page content so users can see positive reviews of the section they are currently reading.<br>
- There will be a contact form making interaction easy.<br>
- There will be downloadable menus with prices so patrons can look and check at their leisure, prior to visit.<br>
- Each page could contain a subscribe to the newsletter section, encouraging patrons to keep in touch with the bar.<br>

 ### Design

**Colour Scheme**

-#18273A, a dark navy blue.  Used  mostly for title/header sections <br>
-#9AB4D5, a lighter blue. Mostly used for main content sections to contrast with the dark blue whilst keeping the theme. <br>
-#ff3df9, a neon pink. Used for highlights, outlines, buttons etc.<br>
-White and black were used in the navbar and footer and in typography for contrast.

![Colour scheme](./docs/colour-scheme.png)

- The two shades of blue are a nod to traditional 'heritage' colours of old fashioned pubs, the navy blue especially referencing the nautical and industrial past of the area. A dark and light shade were chosed so they could be used to 'section off' parts of the webpage.<br>
- The bright, neon pink is a quirky reference the the area's current iteration as a culture and media hub, referencing the neon lights of the BBC and ITV buildings and the Lowry Theatre shining and bouncing off the water of the Quays.<br>
- Black is used for the navbar and footer, giving the site pages a clear top and bottom/ start and end point.

#### Typography
- The Roboto font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the back-up font in case Roboto isn't being imported into the site correctly. Roboto is a clean and simple font which is clear and easy to read used frequently so it is both attractive and fit for purpose.

#### Imagery
-   The large, background hero image of a neon bar sign is striking and catch the user's attention, providing immediate impact. It also has a modern aesthetic and makes the context of the site clear straight away.
- Each review has an image of the reviewer from their socila media adding trust that these are real reviews from real people.
- A selection of appealing images were chosen for the menu cards showing delicious looking food that would be appealing to potential customers.


* ### Wireframes
I used [Balsamiq Wireframes](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/) to create wireframes before starting the project to help me plan the layout and flow of the project.<br>
When I was creating my website, the design plan was changed. Having never done the process before and lacking experience, my first designs were far to simple and lacking content and I had more time to add extra features to the site to add value, for examle, adding page specific reviews with images and a subscription form on every page.

## Testing

### Navigation bar links. 
Home, Gallery, Contact and Menus pages jump to the respective places when clicked. 
- These were tested a number of times. An issue arose when the site moved from the local browswe to published throu Girhub Pages. When this happend the links stopped working and an 'Error 404' page was shown. This was rectified by editing the filepaths to remove "/" at the beginning.
![Navbar Links](/docs/testing/navbar-links-matrix.png)

### Carousel Controls. 
Tested gallery controls checking carousel only moves on as a result of user input.
- The default of the Bootstrap carousel was that it would run automatically however I only wanted the image carousel to move as a result of user input. 
 ![Bootstarp carousel default](./docs/testing/carousel-controls-1.png)
- My first attempt was the change the 'data-ride="carousel"' to 'data-ride="none"'. However, this only changed the behaviour of the first slide, once past the first slide, the rest of the carousel ran automatically.
- After a deep dive into Bootstrap's documentation I added data-interval="false"' to the carousel div to disable the automatic cycling through the slides. 
![Bootstarp carousel fixed](./docs/testing/carousel-controls-2.png)


### Social media links open in the correct destination and in a new tab when clicked.

![Footer links](/docs/testing/footer-links.png)

- All links include 'target="_blank"' to ensure links open in a new tab.

![Footer Links Matrix](/docs/testing/footer-links-matrix.png)

### Contact Page Form. 
- Tested the form on the Contact page. All required fields worked and the submission button worked.
![Contact Form Matrix](/docs/testing/contact-form-matrix.png)

### Subscription Form.
- Tested the form on the Contact page. All required fields worked and the submission button worked.
![Subscription Form Matrix](/docs/testing/subscription-form-matrix.png) 


### Browser Testing.
- Tested with different browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, and Safari(using my phone).

### Screensize and responsivity Testing.
- Tested with different screen sizes using the developer tool (Galaxy Fold, iPad, and my laptop)
    - - The site uses bootstrap across all pages to use a 1, 2, or 3 column layout. One column for small screen sizes, 2 columns for medium screen sizes and 3 columns for large screen sizes.<br>

**Homepage examples**

![Responsive homepage](./docs/responsive-homepage-2.png)

**Navbar examples**
- The site utilises a bootstrap component to collapse the navbar menu items into a toggle when viewing the site on small screens to keep the page neat and tidy.

![Responsive navbar](./docs/testing/responsive-navbar.png)
![Responsive navbar](./docs/testing/responsive-navbar-lg.png)

**Form examples**
- The site utilises media queries to organise form elements on the page in order ro manage space and content effectively. While the site as a whole uses a 3-2-1 bootstrap column design, I found that while this worked on small screens, it was not effective on medium to large screens as the half header half form weighting was not an effective use of space. After some reading I decided to add a media query to both the contact form and the subscription form. This media query and html changed the page make-up so that the header took up one third of the horixontal space while the form element took up two thirds. I also centered the header vertically to even out the use of space.

### Validator Testing

The W3C Markup Validator and W3C CSS Validator Services were used to validate every page of the project to ensure there were no syntax errors in the project.

**HTML**

-   [W3C Markup Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input) - [Results](/docs/testing/w3c-html-validator.png)

**CSS**
-   [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input) - [Results](/docs/testing/w3c-css-validator-1.png)
-This brought the above error. I rectified it and retested. - [Results](/docs/testing/w3c-css-validator-2.png)

### Chrome's DevTools Audit Report

The Google Page-speed Services were used to assess the accessibiity of the project to ensure the site met expected accessible standards on desktop and mobile.

- In early development of the site, the site used two shades of green as opposed to blue. Through testing while coding, it became apparent that these colours did not work well from an accessibility standpoint as there was not enouth contrast. As part of the iterative process, I changed my scheme from green to blues which offered better contrast and accessibility.

![Google Page-Speed Insights Desktop](/docs/testing/page-speed-desktop.png)
![Google Page-Speed Insights Mobile](/docs/testing/page-speed-mobile.png)

-SEO score could be improved by adding a meta description tag to the head.<br>
-Page performance is an issue- possibly down to the large size of the main image on the site. Next steps would be to investigate reducing images without sacrificing quality.

### Lighthouse DevTools Audit Report

Lighthouse was used to assess the accessibiity of the project to ensure the site met expected accessible standards on desktop and mobile.

![Google Page-Speed Insights Desktop](/docs/testing/lighthouse-page-test-desktop.png)
![Google Page-Speed Insights Mobile](/docs/testing/lighthouse-page-test-mobile.png)

-SEO score could be improved by adding a meta description tag to the head.<br>
-Page performance is an issue- possibly down to the large size of the main image on the site. As above, Next steps would be to investigate reducing images without sacrificing quality.
